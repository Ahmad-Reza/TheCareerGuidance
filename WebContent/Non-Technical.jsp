    <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">BSC - Mathematics</h2>
    <p>Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math is all around us, in everything we do. It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices, architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering, and even sports.

Since the beginning of recorded history, mathematic discovery has been at the forefront of every civilized society, and in use in even the most primitive of cultures. The needs of math arose based on the wants of society. The more complex a society, the more complex the mathematical needs. Primitive tribes needed little more than the ability to count, but also relied on math to calculate the position of the sun and the physics of hunting.

History of mathematics

Several civilizations — in China, India, Egypt, Central America and Mesopotamia — contributed to mathematics as we know it today. The Sumerians were the first people to develop a counting system. Mathematicians developed arithmetic, which includes basic operations, multiplication, fractions and square roots. The Sumerians’ system passed through the Akkadian Empire to the Babylonians around 300 B.C. Six hundred years later, in America, the Mayans developed elaborate calendar systems and were skilled astronomers. About this time, the concept of zero was developed.

As civilizations developed, mathematicians began to work with geometry, which computes areas and volumes to make angular measurements and has many practical applications. Geometry is used in everything from home construction to fashion and interior design.

Geometry went hand in hand with algebra, invented in the ninth century by a Persian mathematician, Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi. He also developed quick methods for multiplying and diving numbers, which are known as algorithms — a corruption of his name.

Algebra offered civilizations a way to divide inheritances and allocate resources. The study of algebra meant mathematicians were solving linear equations and systems, as well as quadratics, and delving into positive and negative solutions. Mathematicians in ancient times also began to look at number theory. With origins in the construction of shape, number theory looks at figurate numbers, the characterization of numbers, and theorems.

    <h3>What is the importance of mathematics?</h3>
    <p>Mathematics is a methodical application of matter. Mathematics makes our life orderly and prevents chaos. Mathematics is also the power of our reasoning, creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving ability.

  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="chem">
    <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">BSC - Chemestry</h2>
    <p>You might think of chemistry only in the context of lab tests, food additives or dangerous substances, but the field of chemistry involves everything around us. 

"Everything you hear, see, smell, taste, and touch involves chemistry and chemicals (matter)," according to the American Chemical Society (ACS), a non-profit science organization for the advancement of chemistry, chartered by the U.S. Congress. "And hearing, seeing, tasting, and touching all involve intricate series of chemical reactions and interactions in your body."

So, even if you don't work as a chemist, you're doing chemistry, or something that involves chemistry, with pretty much everything you do. In everyday life, you do chemistry when you cook, when you use cleaning detergents to wipe off your counter, when you take medicine or when you dilute concentrated juice so that the taste isn't as intense.
The reason why chemistry touches everything we do is because almost everything in existence can be broken down into chemical building blocks.

The main building blocks in chemistry are chemical elements, which are substances made of a single atom. Each chemical is unique, composed of a set number of protons, neutrons and electrons, and is identified by a name and a chemical symbol, such as "C" for carbon. The elements that scientists have discovered so far are listed in the periodic table of elements, and include both elements that are found in nature like carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, as well as those that are manmade, like Lawrencium.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the purpose of chemistry?</h3>
    <p>Because it is so fundamental to our world, chemistry plays a role in everyone's lives and touches almost every aspect of our existence in some way. Chemistry is essential for meeting our basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, energy, and clean air, water, and soil.

    <h3>WHY DO NURSES NEED RESEARCH?</h3>
    <p>Research helps nurses determine effective best practices and improve patient care. Nurses in an online RN to BSN program learn to retrieve, read, critique and apply nursing research. Because new information is always coming to light, it is crucial that BSN-prepared nurses know the importance of research. The findings from peer-reviewed studies can correct old misunderstandings, pave the way for new treatment protocols and create new methodology — all of which improve patient outcomes.

Research also helps nursing respond to changes in the healthcare environment, patient populations and government regulations. As researchers make discoveries, the practice of nursing continues to change. The information students learn can become quickly outdated, so being able to keep up with new developments in nursing helps graduates in their careers.

Every nurse can benefit from knowing why nursing research is important, how research is conducted and how research informs patient care. Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) programs teach nurses to appreciate and use research in their everyday careers, compare findings and read published research.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">BSC - Geology</h3>
    <p>Geology (from the Ancient Greek γῆ, gē ("earth") and -λoγία, -logia, ("study of", "discourse") is an Earth
     science concerned with the solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they 
     change over time. Geology can also include the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet or 
     natural satellite such as Mars or the Moon. Modern geology significantly overlaps all other Earth sciences,
      including hydrology and the atmospheric sciences, and so is treated as one major aspect of integrated Earth system science and planetary science.

Kinney Lake and Mount Whitehorn near Mount Robson, Canada Geology describes the structure of the Earth 
on and beneath its surface, and the processes that have shaped that structure. It also provides tools to
 determine the relative and absolute ages of rocks found in a given location, and also to describe the
  histories of those rocks.[3] By combining these tools, geologists are able to chronicle the geological 
  history of the Earth as a whole, and also to demonstrate the age of the Earth. Geology provides the primary 
  evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and the Earth's past climates.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">BSC - Pharmacy</h3>
    <p>Pharmacy is the clinical health science that links medical science with chemistry and it is charged
     with the discovery, production, disposal, safe and effective use, and control of medications and drugs. 
     The practice of pharmacy requires excellent knowledge of drugs, their mechanism of action, side effects, 
     interactions, mobility and toxicity. At the same time, it requires knowledge of treatment and
      understanding of the pathological process. Some specialties of pharmacists, such as that of clinical 
      pharmacists, require other skills, e.g. knowledge about the acquisition and evaluation of physical and 
      laboratory data.
The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications,
 and it also includes more modern services related to health care, including clinical services, reviewing
  medications for safety and efficacy, and providing drug information. Pharmacists, therefore, are the experts
   on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients.
