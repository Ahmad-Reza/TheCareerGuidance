    <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Mechanical Engineering</h2>
    <p>Mechanical engineering is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics 
    principles with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.
    It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.The mechanical engineering field requires
    an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.[2][3]
Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century; 
however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world. In the 19th century,
 developments in physics led to the development of mechanical engineering science. The field has continually 
 evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as 
 composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. It also overlaps with aerospace engineering, metallurgical engineering,
  civil engineering, electrical engineering, manufacturing engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering,
   and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts. Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of 
   biomedical engineering, specifically with biomechanics, transport phenomena, biomechatronics, bionanotechnology, and modelling of biological systems.

    <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Electronic Engineering</h2>
    <p>Electronic engineering (also called electronics and communications engineering) is an electrical engineering discipline which utilizes nonlinear and active electrical components (such as semiconductor devices, especially transistors and diodes) to design electronic circuits, devices, integrated circuits and their systems. The discipline typically also designs passive electrical components, usually based on printed circuit boards.
Electronics is a subfield within the wider electrical engineering academic subject but denotes a broad engineering field that covers subfields such as analog electronics, digital electronics, consumer electronics, embedded systems and power electronics. Electronics engineering deals with implementation of applications, principles and algorithms developed within many related fields, for example solid-state physics, radio engineering, telecommunications, control systems, signal processing, systems engineering, 
computer engineering, instrumentation engineering, electric power control, robotics, and many others.
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is one of the most important and influential 
organizations for electronics engineers based in the US. On an international level, the International Electrotechnical 
Commission (IEC) prepares standards for electronic engineering, developed through consensus and thanks to the
 work of 20,000 experts from 172 countries worldwide.

    <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Civil Engineering</h2>
    <p>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.[1][2]

Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest
 engineering discipline after military engineering,[3] and it is defined to distinguish non-military 
 from military engineering.[4] Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public
  works departments through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies.

    <h3>7 Steps to Prepare for Your Job Interview</h3><br>
    <p><h4>1. Pick your outfit:</h4>
What you wear in your interview is an absolutely crucial part of how to prepare for a job interview. After you choose your outfit, 
make sure it is cleaned and pressed and you have the appropriate accessories and shoes to go with it. It doesn’t hurt to try the outfit
 on ahead of time, just to make sure everything fits and you look great. Then put your outfit aside for the day of your interview and 
 have it ready to go. Now that you have this crucial step out of the way, you can concentrate on the rest.
<h4>2. Practice greeting your interviewer:</h4><br>
<p>You should always greet your interview with a friendly smile and firm handshake. If you do this right, you will set off the right energy 
and the chances of the interview going well will increase. This is a small and simple step that you should always do to prepare for your
 interview.</p><br>
<h4>3. Study your resume and know everything about it:</h4>
<p>Any work experience or skills you have listed on your resume are fair game to talk about during the interview. 
Your resume is all the interviewer has to go by in order to get to know you. They may pick things out from it and ask you to elaborate.
 Even though you may have a previous job listed that was many years ago, the interviewer may ask you to explain what you did at that 
 job and you are responsible for providing an answer. This is one step you absolutely won’t want to skip on how to prepare for a job 
 interview.</p><br>

<h4>4. Practice your answers to the most common interview questions:</h4>
<p>If you don’t know what these are, do your research and find out or see one of my other articles. You’ll want to have your answers ready and practice them. You should always be able to answer “Tell me about yourself” and “Why do you think you would be great for this job?” The employer doesn’t know, so it’s up to you to sell it.
Don’t completely memorize your answers so they come out rehearsed, but have a clear idea of what you are going to say. 
When you are asked, you want your answer to come out intelligently and naturally. Be open to other questions as well and really know 
what you can offer to the company.</p><br>

<h4>5. Research the company and the job position you are applying for:</h4><br>
<p>Write down any questions you may have about either so you can ask during the interview. 
If there any requirement of the job that you are unsure of, you should definitely ask during the interview. 
It always looks nice when you go into an interview with intelligent questions. It shows you put effort into preparing for the interview.
 However, never ask questions just to ask questions. The interviewer will see right through that. Your questions should be genuine and
  relevant.</p><br>

<h4>6. Find out the type of interview you will be going on:</h4><br>
<p>There are several common types of interviews such as one on one, group, and behavioral. You shouldn’t assume you will get a certain one.
 Don’t be afraid to ask your recruiter what kind of interview will have if you don’t know – the interview will be more beneficial to 
 both parties if you are prepared.</P><br>

<h4>7. Print out the directions to the interview and be on time:</h4><br>
<p>Allow enough time to get there and anticipate traffic. It’s ok to be up to 10 minutes early, but no more than that. Otherwise, 
the interviewer may not be ready for you. Bring the phone number of your interviewer just in case you get lost or are going to be late.
 If you are going to be late, call to let the interviewer know.
